# Metaclassifier

*Metaclassifier* is a python library/tools design to help with classification in **ML** datasets. It allow classify text using a **CLI** interface. And will allow Telegram bots and a web interface for distributed classification.

For now reads from a *json* and write to another but we intended to allow multiple source of income and saving the data.

For use the CLI interface exec:

``` {.bash}
python -m metaclassifier console data_example.json
```


For use the webapp interface exec (still missing webapp specific configs):

``` {.bash}
python -m metaclassifier webapp data_example.json
```
